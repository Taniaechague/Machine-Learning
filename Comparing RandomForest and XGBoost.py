### Comparing Random Forest and XGBoost modeling performance
# Use scikit-learn to implement Random Forest and XGBoost regression models
# Compare the performances of the two models
# In this lab, you'll create and measure the relative performances of Random Forest and XGBoost regression models for predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset. 'Performance' means both speed and accuracy.

# Load the California Housing dataset
data = fetch_california_housing()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Ej1: How many observations and features does the dataset have?
N_observations, N_features = X.shape
print('Number of Observations: ' + str(N_observations))
print('Number of Features: ' + str(N_features))
#This is a moderately sized dataset used for this analysis. Keep in mind you are only using one dataset so you have to consider that the comparison may change with scale.


# Initialize models
#In this step you define the number of base estimators, or individual trees, to be used in each model, and then intialize models for Random Forest regression and XGBoost regression. You'll just use the default parameters to make the performance comparisons. As a part of the performance comparison, we'll also measure the training times for both models.
# Initialize models
n_estimators=100
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=n_estimators, random_state=42)
xgb = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=n_estimators, random_state=42)

# Measure training time for Random Forest

start_time_xgb = time.time()
xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)
end_time_xgb = time.time()
xgb_train_time = end_time_xgb - start_time_xgb


# Ej2: Use the fitted models to make predictions on the test set.
#Also, measure the time it takes for each model to make its predictions using the time.time() function to measure the times before and after each model prediction.
# Measure prediction time for Random Forest
start_time_rf = time.time()
y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test)

# Ej3: Calulate the MSE and R^2 values for both models
mse_rf = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_rf)
mse_xgb = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_xgb)
r2_rf = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)
r2_xgb = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_xgb)

# Ej4: Print the MSE and R^2 values for both models
print(f'Random Forest:  MSE = {mse_rf:.4f}, R^2 = {r2_rf:.4f}')
print(f'      XGBoost:  MSE = {mse_xgb:.4f}, R^2 = {r2_xgb:.4f}')
#You can see from the MSE and R^2 values that XGBoost is better than Random Forest, but the differences aren't overwhelming.

# Ej5: Print the timings for each model
print(f'Random Forest:  Training Time = {rf_train_time:.3f} seconds, Testing time = {rf_pred_time:.3f} seconds')
print(f'      XGBoost:  Training Time = {xgb_train_time:.3f} seconds, Testing time = {xgb_pred_time:.3f} seconds')
#What is very impressive is the difference in computation time between XGBoost and Random Forest for both training and testing.
#Next, you want to generate scatter plots between the predicted and actual values for both models so you can visually evaluate how well each model performs. We'll also plot lines one standard deviation of the test data above and below the ideal line, that is, the line that represents the perfect regressor, where the predictions are all correct.

#EJ6: Calculate the standard deviation of the test data
# Standard deviation of y_test
std_y = np.std(y_test)

#Both models performed very well. Most of their predictions fall within a standard deviation of the target. Interestingly, random forest "respects" the upper bound (the maximum value) present in the target by staying within its limits, while XGBoost "overshoots", or exceeds this limit.
